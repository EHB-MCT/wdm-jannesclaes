# Contributing to this Project

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! 

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug, please create a new issue in the repository. Be sure to include:
* A clear title and description.
* Steps to reproduce the bug.
* The expected behavior versus the actual behavior.

### 2. Suggesting Enhancements
If you have an idea for a new feature, feel free to open an issue to discuss it first. This saves you time in case the feature is already being worked on or doesn't fit the project goals.

### 3. Pull Request Process (Submitting Code)
1.  **Fork** the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure your code follows the coding standards defined in `STANDARDS.md`.
4.  Make sure your code lints and builds correctly.
5.  Issue that pull request!

## Coding Style
